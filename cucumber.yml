    # Results are published to Cucumber Pro using HTTP/HTTPS. Each Cucumber Pro project has a token for this purpose.
    # You can find it in the project settings (press `?` to display it).
    # This token should be assigned to a `CUCUMBERPRO_RESULTS_TOKEN` environment variable on the build server, on a per-project basis.
    # Consult your CI server's documentation for details about defining per-project environment variables.

    # the configuration locally.
